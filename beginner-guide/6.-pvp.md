# 6. PvP

PvP is allowed as long as you are not using exploits to attack other players in regions that are intended to have PvP protection(inside claims, most of the spawn, etc).

## Penalty and Reward

The following rules only apply in areas designated for PvP, such as the Gem Mine. When killed by another player, the victim loses 20% of their current balance, half of which is given to the killer. Combat logs result in losing 50% of the current balance.
