# Fishing

When fishing in the adventure world, custom fish can be caught by completing mini-games. These fish can be sold to the [fisherman ](../beginner-guide/4.-npc-spoiler.md)for money. The new fishing system is accompanied by treasure and dangers. For instance, you can obtain gems from fishing, but... you might also fish up some hostile mobs.
