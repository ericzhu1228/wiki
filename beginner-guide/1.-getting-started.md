# 1. Getting Started

## Server Resource Pack

Using the Server Resource Pack is not required but <mark style="color:blue;">**STRONGLY SUGGESTED**</mark>.

When joining the server for the first time, you will receive a message to enable the server resource pack. Click "<mark style="color:blue;">**Yes**</mark>" to automatically download the resource pack. (You can change the option through "Edit" in the server list menu)

## Menu

You can access many features through the server menu instead of remembering commands. Use **\[**<mark style="color:blue;">**Shift + f**</mark>**]** keys to open the menu(hold the key for sneaking and then press the key for swapping items. The actual key binds depend on your client settings.)

## What to do first?

We suggest trying out the tutorial dungeon, and after completing the dungeon, you will be given 10 Frenzied Netherite Ingot. You can use them to forge the Frenzied Netherite Set at the [blacksmith](4.-npc-locations-spoiler.md) at the spawn (click to jump to where to find NPC).

You can also start playing in the same way you do vanilla Minecraft.\
Use the command "<mark style="color:blue;">**/rtp**</mark>" and select the Overworld to teleport randomly.

Alternatively, feel free to explore around the spawn to discover various features and pick your way to start!
