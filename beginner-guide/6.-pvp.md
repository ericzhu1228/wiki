# 6. PvP

PvP is allowed as long as you are not using exploits to attack other players in regions that are intended to have PvP protection(inside claims, most of the spawn, etc).

## Penalty and Reward

When killed by another player, the victim loses 20% of their current balance, and half of it will be given to the killer.
