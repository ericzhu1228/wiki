# 3. Intro to Gameplay

## Overview

MCTown is a survival server with various gameplay improvements. Thus, similar to vanilla Minecraft, you can grind for better gears, create fantastic builds, join player communities, and more! Be creative and do anything you want.

## Not sure what to do?

You have full freedom to choose what you want to do, but below are some options to explore if you're unsure about which aspect of the gameplay to focus on.

## Adventure

Adventure is one of the major aspects of the server. However, mobs in the adventure world(access through /rtp) are very strong, so it's suggested to obtain full enchanted netherite gears first. When you are ready, explore the world, loot structures, slay mobs, and upgrade your equipment at the blacksmith. Fight to become the strongest player on the server!

## Getting Rich!

Money is essential! You can use it to purchase a variety of goods from the server shop, upgrade your equipment, or trade with other players. There are many ways to get rich. For example, you can check out the Agriculture, Food, and Fishing options from the "CONTENT" section below.

## Slimefun

Slimefun allows you to build modern factories, storages, and item transfer systems which are essential for gathering resources for various uses such as building and crafting. It also comes with many magical items that provide great utilities. A complete material production system will be your strongest support through your game progress!
