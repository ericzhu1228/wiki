# Intro

The adventure system centers around new gears, mobs, and challenges. You can obtain materials from the adventure world(/rtp) by looting chests and killing mobs in randomly generated dungeons. With the materials, you can forge advanced gears with custom skills at the blacksmith.\
\
A few things to note:\
1\. Most [dungeons](dungeons/) only generate in specific biomes\
2\. [Mobs](mobs/) heal 10% of their maximum health(prior to [Mob Levels Scaling](mobs/mob-levels.md)) when killing a player\
3\. The adventure world resets every once in a while
