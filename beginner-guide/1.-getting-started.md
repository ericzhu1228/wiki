# 1. Getting Started

## Server Resource Pack

Using the Server Resource Pack is not required but <mark style="color:blue;">**STRONGLY SUGGESTED**</mark>.

When joining the server for the first time, you will receive a message to enable the server resource pack. Click "<mark style="color:blue;">**Yes**</mark>" to automatically download the resource pack. (You can change the option through "Edit" in the server list menu)

## Menu

You can access many features through the server menu instead of remembering commands. Use **\[**<mark style="color:blue;">**Shift + f**</mark>**]** keys to open the menu(hold the key for sneaking and then press the key for swapping items. The actual key binds depend on your client settings.)

## What to do first?

You can start playing the same way as playing vanilla Minecraft.\
Use the command "<mark style="color:blue;">**/rtp**</mark>" and select the Overworld to randomly teleport.

Alternatively, feel free to explore around the spawn to discover various features and pick your own way to start!
