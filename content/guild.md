# Guild

Create a guild and invite your friends to create your community! Most of the features for the guild should be simple to understand from the in-game menu, but here is some additional information for clarification.&#x20;

## Currencies

Prosperity: \
Guild prosperity is required for upgrading a guild. It is gained from the guild sacred stone based on its level and the number of players online. It can also be acquired from participating in Seasonal Guild PvPs.\

Contributions: \
Players gain guild contributions by signing in using either money or crystals. It is also accessible through Seasonal or Matchmaking Guild PvPs. Contributions can be used in the guild shop for purchases.

Funds:\
Players can donate their contributions to the guild for it to gain guild funds. The leader of the guild can use funds to upgrade the guild, create a guild world, upgrade the sacred stone, and more.

Ores:\
Guild ore is a special type of currency under the sacred stone section. Guild leaders can use guild ores to upgrade stats buff for all guild members. Members can use contributions to mine ores for the guild.
