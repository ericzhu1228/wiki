# 3. Intro to Gameplay

You have complete freedom to choose what you want to do, but here are some choices for you to explore if you don't know what part of the gameplay you want to focus on.

## Adventure

Adventure is one of the major aspects of the server. However, mobs in the adventure world are very strong, so it's suggested to obtain full enchanted netherite gears first. When you are ready, explore, loot structures, slain mobs, and upgrade your equipment at the blacksmith. Fight to become the strongest player on the server!

## Getting Rich!

Money is essential! You can use it to purchase a variety of goods from the server shop, upgrade your equipment, or trade with other players. There are many ways to get rich. For example, you can check out the Agriculture, Food, and Fishing options from the "CONTENT" section below.

## Slimefun

Slimefun allows you to build modern factories, storages, and item transfer systems which are essential for gathering resources for various uses such as building and crafting. It also comes with many magical items that provide great utilities. A complete material production system will be your strongest support through your game progress!
