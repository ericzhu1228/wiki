Virtual goods and services purchased are owned by MCTown and are not your property. MCTown may manage, regulate, control, modify, or eliminate all virtual goods and services purchased at any time, without notice or announcement and without payment to you. MCTown shall have no liability to you or any third party if MCTown exercises any such rights. All charges incurred in connection with the services are payable in advance, final, and are not refundable in whole or in part, for any reason, except as required by applicable consumer rights law in your local jurisdiction. You will not receive money or other compensation for unused virtual goods and services purchased when an account is closed, whether such closure was voluntary or involuntary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, MCTown may, in its sole discretion, issue a refund to you if you have, within sixty (60) days, provided an appropriate reason for requesting such a refund.
